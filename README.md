### System Design Notes
This is a mark of journey beginning with eductive.io system design module. After learning system design through projects in experience , it's time to view and revisit the topics in more academical way. git pages is better way to look into these topics for me, I shall add questions, further reading in pipeline as new issues which can be tracked and the material can be further refined as I see new projects in my experience. 

As of now expectng no contribution, if any user can benefit from these notes feel free to propose some collaborative learning.
